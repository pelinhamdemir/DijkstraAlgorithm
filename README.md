Shortest Path in a Road Network using Dijkstra's Algorithm


The objective of this code is to determine the shortest path between two cities in a road network. The code requires the implementation of an undirected weighted graph data structure and the implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm. Additionally, the user can specify a stopover city before reaching the destination city. The code will find the shortest paths to reach the user-specified stopover cities.

Implementation
The implementation involves the following steps:

Implement an undirected weighted graph data structure to represent the road network.
Read the road network information from a file, including cities, distances, and connections.
Implement Dijkstra's algorithm to efficiently find the shortest path between the source and destination cities.
Allow the user to specify a stopover city before reaching the destination city.
Find the shortest paths to reach the user-specified stopover cities.
Output the optimal route and total distance for each scenario.
